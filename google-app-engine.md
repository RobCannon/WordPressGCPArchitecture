# Google App Engine
Google App Engine is a Platform as a Service offering that allows you to run your applications without having to be concerned with low level infrastructure concerns like operating system patching and configuration. It also automates functions like scaling and availability.

Google App Engine can easily integrate with other services like [Google Cloud Load Balancing](./cloud-load-balancing.md) and [Google CDN](cloud-cdn.md) to provide services on a global scale with minimal effort.
