# Google Cloud CDN
Google Cloud CDN can cache content from WordPress across the globe and make access closer and thereby faster for users no matter where they are in the internet. Since the content of this site does not change often, a CDN is an excellent choice to make content available without having to go back to the the WordPress app and the database to retrieve the web page.
